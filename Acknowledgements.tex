I want to thank my colleague Marcel Cimander for working with me on this project for the last year and his great work on GPredict which will hopefully soon be a part of the official release cycle. I would also like to thank Alexandru Csete for his wonderful work on GPredict, the fact that he also still maintains the Win32 build of the software and for his kind consideration.\\

I also want to thank Mr Dipl.-Ing. Mag. Christian Siehs for "pushing" me into web development as otherwise I would most likely not have been able to pursue this project the way I did. Additionally I would like thank my girlfriend who had to cope with me for the time I was working on this project and proved an extreme resilience to my grumpiness when facing a major bug.\\

Finally I would like to thank Mr FH-Prof. Dipl. Ing. Dr. Mehnen, who approached and trusted us with this very demanding but also very rewarding project. I would never have dreamed of actually working on a project of such a scale within my undergraduate program.

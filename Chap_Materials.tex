\chapter{Material}
The following sections list the different tools used while working on the components of the BOINSO network applications.

\section{General}
This section includes tools which allow a group of developers to work on complex projects in a decentralized manner. As this project is intended to be used in an academic context and monetary resources are scarce in this field tools that are either open source or free of charge for educational programs.

\subsection{GIT-SCM}
The \ac{git-scm} is a "[...] fast, scalable, distributed revison control system with a [...] rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals" as declared in \cite{git_scm}. It follows the same "branch -> develop -> merge" work-flow as \ac{SVN} and is freely distributed under the \ac{GPLv2}. It was originally developed by Linus Torvalds to offer Linux Kernel developers a free way to collaboratively work on a distributed code-base efficiently.

\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub is a provider of cloud hosted \ac{git-scm} repositories. As GitHub was originally introduced by members of the open source community it still maintains a very generous relationship to open source contributors. GitHub users who publish their work to public repositories may use virtually all services bound to the GitHub infrastructure free of charge with only minimal limitations. GitHub also offers premium enterprise accounts which include a certain amount of private repositories and premium services if they are needed.

\subsection{Travis-CI}
Travis-CI is a web hosted continuous integration server. Continuous integration is the automated process of building and testing a project with every introduction or modification of a software component. Its goal is to assure and improve the quality of the project while alerting the development team if a change would lead to a breaking application.\\

In contrast of other continuous integration solutions like Jenkins -- an open source continuous integration server implemented in the Java programming language -- the configuration of a Travis-CI process is done by adding a simple configuration file to root of your \ac{git-scm} repository as seen in listing \ref{lst:travis.yml}.\\

\lstinputlisting[language=yaml, caption={BOINSO Travis-CI configuration file. For this file type the YAML syntax is used. The built process runs once for every Python interpreter version included in the configuration. Services like a data base connection can be included and configured prior to the built process. It is possible to include command line expressions and additional hooks which react to Travis-CI events.}, label=lst:travis.yml]{listings/.travis.yml}

\subsection{Vagrant}
Vagrant is a tool which is used to virtualize development environments. It offers a command line interface to download, start up, pause, halt and provision images of virtual machines which come configured with all the dependencies needed to develop, run and test an application. Base images can be built to closely model a production system as closely as possible being configured by a trained system administrator masking the complexity of this system from developers and designers. Depending on the base image type Vagrant users have to have access to a certain virtualization provider -- also known as hypervisor.\\

The initialization process of a Vagrant environment depends on the presence of a vagrant configuration file -- simply known as the Vagrantfile. Listing \ref{lst:Vagrantfile} depicts the Vagrantfile of the BOINSO Core Web Application.\\

Provisioning can be done by DevOps tools like Puppet or Chef or any other program used in this context. As the scope and the resources of this project are limited a simple shell provisioner was used. An example for a provisioning script can be seen in listing \ref{lst:bootstrap_prov}.\\

\subsection{Open Source Licensing}
Open source software is easy to extend and distribute as portability issues can be solved directly in the source code. Unfortunately there are numerous developers and companies which sole purpose seems to be the destruction of open source projects through the medium of patenting and licensing schemes. To protect a project and its collaborators a well established software license should be used. The \ac{FSS} provides a set of licenses and guidelines for their own licensing products and affiliated licenses. A starter guide for choosing the right free software license can be found at \cite{fss_license_guide}. Project initiator should be aware that licenses recommended by the \ac{FSS} are most likely going to be rather strict free software licenses which makes later commercial use harder in many cases. That is the reason for the BOINSO project favoring the Apache~License~2.0.

\section{BOINSO Core Web Application}
This section focuses on the tools and frameworks used to implement the core of the BOINSO Core Web Application.

\subsection{pip}
In a modern Python environment pip is used to manage Python modules. Pip itself is a python module which accesses the \ac{PyPI}, downloads a module and its dependencies, starts the compilation process for Python extensions and either adds the module to the global Python interpreters Python path or the path of a local virtual Python environment. Besides installing single packages on demand for console execution pip can also be used as a dependency management tool. Rather than manually managing all dependencies of a projects developers normally include a requirements.txt file to their project roots which is used by pip to install project dependencies in the right version. Listing \ref{std:requirements.txt} shows the requirements.txt file of the BOINSO Core Web Application.\\

\lstinputlisting[language=Python, caption={BOINSO Core Web Application requirements.txt file including project dependencies and their version. Version notation follows the "major.minor.patch" pattern. Omitting versioning information means that the latest available version of a module will be installed -- in this case this is not likely to cause problems as sphinx is only used to generate documentation.}, label=std:requirements.txt]{listings/requirements.txt}

\subsection{Virtualenv}
Virtualenv is a Python command line tool to create local light weight Python environments with encapsulated tools and an isolated Python module path. Virtual environments can be activated on a per shell basis and replace the system's standard Python installation in this scope. Virtualenv is used to separate the dependencies of a distinct application from other project as different dependency versions are prone to errors when being installed to the same context.

\subsection{Django}
Django is one of the major Python web frameworks. It is backed by a very committed developer community, easy to use, secure and scalable. Without further configuration it includes powerful management tools, database independent \ac{ORM} facilities, an intuitive template engine and an automatically generated administration interface. The project maintainers offer these tools but are very keen on making sure that all components are as modular as possible. This means that almost all components can be substituted by other established projects (e.g.: Jinja template engine instead of Django template engine or SQLAlchemy \ac{ORM} instead of Django \ac{ORM}). Besides substituting core components the Django app system also allows developers to write framework extensions which add additional functionality.\\

Django can be used to its full potential when working on data driven dynamic web applications. To give developers granular control of application functionality and to enforce a maintainable code base the framework makes extensive use of the \ac{MVC} pattern. Figure \ref{fig:MVC} shows the typical collaborative processes between the different \ac{MVC} components.

\end{figure}

\minisec{Model}
The model is the programmatic representation of an entity. The \ac{ORM} implementation maps the different data members of the model class to a table in the databases and casts the fields to the related database vendor type implementations. An example for a simple model implementation can be seen in listing \ref{lst:boinso_models}. Besides the correct mapping to the data base the field types also allow the usage of validation chains which throw errors if input values violate input constraints.\\

\minisec{View}
The view is the layer in which data is presented to clients who can interact with it without having knowledge of the underlying logic. In classical Django applications a view is called a template and rendered to a \ac{HTML} document presented to a web browser. The BOINSO Core Web Application makes use of the Django \ac{REST} Framework where a serializer is used instead of a template. Listing \ref{lst:boinso_serializers} shows the serializer related to the satellite model shown in listing \ref{lst:boinso_models} extending a model serializer provided by the Django \ac{REST} Framework which provides resource identification and resource location by \ac{URL} fields catering to the \ac{HATEOAS} principle introduced in \cite{Fielding_2000}.\\

\minisec{Controller}
The controller reacts to signals set by the user, manipulates the state of a model and updates views. Business logic is incorporated in this component. In the Django vernacular a controller is -- to the confusion of many users -- called a view. A sample of a more complex controller is depicted in listing \ref{lst:boinso_views} where a client request containing an OAuth2 access token is used to filter for the related user object. The view establishes the connection to the serializer class and checks requests for both authentication (client is registered user) and permission (registered user has the rights to view/modify requested data).\\
